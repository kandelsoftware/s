Nakshatras 
There are 27 Nakshatras. But in Sarvatobhadra Chakra Abhijit Nakshatra is also used. In all, 28 Nakshatras are  used in SBC. Their names & characteristics are given in Chapter 4. Abhijit Nakshatra is not used in following  cases: 
 Fixing the year of events - based on Janma Nakshatra as first year of native's life.  Deciding the favorable & unfavorable Nakshatras by dividing them into 9 groups - three Nakshatras in  one group.  
Note 
Abhijit Nakshatra extends from 9R 6° 40' 0" to 9s 10° 53' 20". 
New Ch 
Ch is invisible on last day of the month known as Amavasya. After Amavasya, a small curve is seen in the sky  on Pratipada of Sukla Paksha. This rise of Ch is classified as New Ch. 
Sankranti 
When Sy leaves a Rasi & enters another Rasi, it is known as Sankranti. I.e. when Sy enters Mesha Rasi, it is  known as Mesh Sankranti. 
Grahas - combustion & rise 
When a Graha, during the course of its transit, comes near Sy or Sy comes near Graha, Graha disappears due to  severe light of Sy. That phenomenon is known as combustion of Graha. When Graha reappears & is visible, it is  known as Uday (rise) of Graha. Ma, Sa & Gu are always combust in West direction & again rise in East. Bu & Sk are combust in West & East also. They rise in both directions.  
Graha - retrograde & direct 
When a Graha, in transit, move straight, it is known as direct and when a Graha turns its direction due to heat  of Sy it is known as retrograde. Direct Graha always goes ahead. Whereas the retrograde Graha's longitude  reduces gradually. Sy & Ch are always direct. Whereas Ra & Ke are always retrograde. Other Grahas are direct  & retrograde also. This position of Grahas can be ascertained from Ephemeris. 
Important features of a horoscope – Chakra 
 Every horoscope has 12 Bhavas. 
 Bhava no. 1, 4, 7, 10 are known as Kendras (angles). 
 Bhava no. 5 & 9 are known as Trikonas (trines). 
 Bhava no. 2, 5, 8, 11 are known as Panapharas (cadent). 
 Bhava no. 3, 6, 9, 12 are known as Apoklimas (succedent). 
 Malefic Grahas are Sy, wanning Ch, Ma, Sa, Ra, Ke, Bu - whenever with a malefic Graha.  Benefic Grahas are Gu, Sk, waxing Ch ,Bu – when alone. 
Misc. matters about horoscope 
 Any Graha in 5th or 9th Bhava gives benefic results. 
 Lords of 3rd, 6th and 11th Bhava are always malefic & they do not give benefic results if Lords are  malefic. 
 Benefic Lords of 4th, 7th and 10th Bhava are 100% malefic, even Gu & Sk, unless they occupy their own  or exaltation Rasi. 
 Malefic Lords of 4th, 7th, 10th are 100% benefic. 
 Lords of 5th & 9th Bhava are 100% benefic. 
 Lords of 2nd & 12th Bhava are neutral, provided they do not own any other Bhava.  Lord of 8th Bhava is most malefic. 
 Lord of 8th Bhava when also Lord of Lagna gives 50% benefic results. 
 Lords of 4th, 7th & 10th Bhava (Gu & Sk), if occupy 2nd or 7th Bhava, are 100% malefic & become Maraka.  Lord of 4th, 7th & 10th Bhava if Bu, occupies 2nd or 7th Bhava, is 50% malefic & 50% Maraka.  Lord of 4th, 7th & 10th Bhava if Ch, occupies 2nd or 7th Bhava, is 25% malefic & 25% Maraka.
7

 Lords of 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, 5th and 9th Bhavas, if related to each other, especially by conjunction or  exchange of Kendra Lord with Trikona Lord give Raj Yogas. 
 If Lords of 4th, 7th, 10th, 5th and 9th have malefic tendencies they give malefic results even if they are Yogi  Grahas (this happens when Lords of 4th, 7th, 10th Bhava are benefic Grahas). 
 Astrology is an applied science. Our Sages used to apply it extensively for prediction of all matters  about the world, individuals, war & peace, market fluctuations, life & death of native, happy events & unhappy events, victory & defeat. 
 Malefic Lords of 6th, 8th & 12th Bhava are less malefic than benefic Lords of 4th, 7th & 10th Bhava.  Lagna Lord is 100% benefic. 
 Malefic Lord of 4th, 7th & 10th Bhava if also Lords of 5th or 9th Bhava are Yogi Grahas. Sarvatobhadra Chakra & its constituents 
Abhijit Nakshatra is specially applied in SBC. It starts from Uttara Shada, last Pada, ends in Sravana, 2nd Pada.  Longitude 276° 40' to 280° 53' 20".

Note 
If consonant is Ja, the Swar (vowel) will be EE & Tithi will be 2. 
From the consonant also determine the Nakshatra of that word, from Nakshatra determine Rasi & Pada.  This Chakra should be applied when the original horoscope of the native is not available.  When consonant is available (from the popular name), decide the vowel & Tithi from above Chakra.  When two words are joined in the name, take the vowel which belongs to first word. 
 When the first word is Swar (vowel) itself, consider it as Swar (vowel) & consonant also.  When an individual has many names, consider the latest name only. 
Sapta Nadi

1. Prachand Nadi Nakshatras 
Most dangerous. Indicate travelling, differences, malefic Grahas indicate greatest harm. Benefic Grahas indicate  permanent achievement of high standard and unexpected gains. 
2. Pawan Nadi Nakshatras 
Indicate lot of travelling. Minor benefic and malefic results but very fast. 
3. Dehan Nadi Nakshatras 
Indicate lot of mental tension in that year, avoid working. He will be quarrelsome, hostile, angry, jealous and  spoil his life to some extent. 
4. Sobhya Nadi Nakshatras 
Indicate happy results due to Vedha and transit of benefic Grahas. Ensure benefic results to native & all his  family members. Ensure many type of happy events, never experienced in life. 
5. Neer Nadi Nakshatras 
Indicate uncertainty. Native has to work hard to achieve desired results, otherwise failures. Native gets many  opportunities in this period. 
6. Jal Nadi Nakshatras 
Indicate some benefic events, which are possible during that year only. Ensure also some benefic and malefic  results which are everlasting. 
7. Amrit Nadi Nakshatras

Notes 
 If Nadi Nakshatra Lord alone transits the Nakshatra of the Nadi, result will be as per name of Nadi.  Results are more specific when Ch joins the Nadi along with benefic / malefic Graha.  Full Ch (6th of Sukla Paksha to 5th of Krishna Paksha) along with Lord of the Nadi transit / aspect, most  benefic results are assured.

Saham 
Punya Saham 
Special sensitive point indicating fortunate longitude & its Lord as under:

If the Lord of the above Saham occupies 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, 5th, 9th Bhava, it is most beneficial & fortunate. In other  cases, the native does not get the desired results. Whenever any benefic Graha transits the Saham's longitude &  it’s Lord, fortunate period is indicated. 
Vimshottari Mahadasa 
Find out the Lords of Dasa and Antardasa. If these Lords occupy 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th Nakshatra from Janma Nakshatra, benefic results are assured during Dasa as & when the benefic Graha transit these Lords position in  SBC.

 Whenever a malefic Graha occupy or has Vedha on malefic Nakshatra as indicated above, malefic  results must take place. 
 Whenever two malefic Grahas occupy Janma Nakshatra or have malefic Vedha, the native may fall  sick.

4. Kshemya Nakshatra 
It gives benefic results, which are enjoyed by whole family. 
5. Pratwara Nakshatra

12

Notes 
In SBC 28 Nakshatras are applied. In addition to 27 Nakshatras, Abhijit is also considered. But this Nakshatra is  not considered while fixing the benefic Nakshatras from Janma Nakshatra, i.e. 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th, & malefic  Nakshatras from Janma Nakshatra, 3rd, 5th, 7th. It is also not considered for fixing the years of life, i.e. 1st Nakshatra indicates first year of life & 27th Nakshatra indicates 27th year of life. Again the first Nakshatra
13 


indicates the 28th year of life. Similarly Dasa & Antardasa of Grahas occupying 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th Nakshatra from Janma Nakshatra of native must be examined. Dasa of such Grahas is always benefic.

Note 
Bu's exaltation point is 15° in Kanya. Thereafter its Mooltrikona extends upto 25°. The remaining 5° of Kanya is  his own Bhava. Some Sages consider entire Rasi as an exaltation Rasi & the above mentioned longitude  indicates most exaltation point of these Grahas. 
Navamsa Varga 
In SBC special importance is given to the Navamsa position of a Graha. It is most useful to understand the  micro result of a Graha. To find out the Navamsa, Zodiacal circle (Bhava Chakra) is divided into 108 equal parts  of 3° 20' each. It means that each Rasi is divided into 9 Navamsa parts or it is equal to one Pada of 3° 20' each of  a Nakshatra. The limit of each Navamsa in a Rasi is as under: 
1st Navamsa from 0° 00' to 3° 20' 
2nd Navamsa from 3° 20' to 6° 40' 
3rd Navamsa from 6° 40' to 10° 00' 
4th Navamsa from 10° 00' to 13° 20' 
5th Navamsa from 13° 20' to 16° 40' 
6th Navamsa from 16° 40' to 20° 00' 
7th Navamsa from 20° 00' to 23° 20' 
8th Navamsa from 23° 20' to 26° 40'

Impact of Grahas in transit 
In SBC whole methodology of prediction is based on movement of Grahas in Rasis, Nakshatras & Padas of  Nakshatras & their correct Vedha. Benefic results depend on transit of benefic Grahas on benefic Rasi &  Nakshatra, especially 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th Nakshatra from Janma Nakshatra. Benefic Graha occupying benefic  Rasi or benefic Nakshatra indicates benefic Vedha. 
Conjunction of Grahas in a Nakshatra during transit 
When 2 or 3 Grahas conjunct during transit, the results will be as under: 
 Conjunction of benefic Grahas = Benefic results. 
 Conjunction of malefic Grahas = Malefic results. 
 Conjunction of malefic & benefic Grahas: Results depends on victorious Graha. 
Notes 
 Graha in the North is considered victorious, and Graha in South is considered defeated, except Sk.  Graha with Sy is considered as combust. 
 Graha with Ch is considered in Samagam. 
 Graha with Ma is considered in war - provided their longitudes are in the same Nakshatra.  Graha in Samagam or war, whether in North or South, is victorious if in North Kranti.  Grahas having same nature, occupying same Pada of a Nakshatra, classification of victorious Graha are not necessary. However the will of Graha having more longitude will prevail. 
 Ra or Ke occupying North Kranti will be victorious.
18 

 If both Grahas are in South Kranti, Graha in lesser longitude will be victorious.  If both Grahas are equally strong, both Grahas will give appropriate results according to their  significations. 
 If both Grahas are equally strong - one is friend & other enemy - treat their impact as neutral.  Kranti means two Grahas having the same latitude either in North or South. 
 If both Grahas are in North Kranti, Graha with higher latitude is victorious. 
Vedha of Grahas 
In SBC speed of a Graha is of vital importance because all types of Vedhas depend on speed. Usually Grahas have following types of speed: 
Motion – speed Vedha 
 Direct motion - normal speed Front 
 Direct motion - high speed Left 
 Retrograde motion - backward motion Right 
Direct motion 
When a Graha moves direct without stopping, in anti-clockwise direction, it is known as direct motion, i.e. Graha moving from Mesha to Vrisabha. Its Vedha is always front Vedha. 
Types of Vedha 
In SBC aspect of Grahas is considered most important, because Vedha depends on aspect, which may be direct,  right or left, depending on the speed of a Graha. This aspect is different than the aspect in Vedic Astrology. Their aspect is front when in normal speed, left when in high speed & right Vedha when retrograde.

Strength of rising or combust Grahas 
Rising Grahas (Uday) Numerical strength 
 Sy 60 
Always Uday 
 Ch 60 
Always Uday (from 2nd of Sukla Paksha to Poornima). It reduces proportionally when it is in Krishna Paksha. Example: Ch is in 7th Tithi of Sukla Paksha. Numerical strength will be: 60 / 14 x 7 = 30.  Ra & Ke 00 
Never rising. 
 Other Grahas 60 
When they are released from combustion & enter their own Rasi. 
 Other Grahas 00 
When combust 
Combustion of Grahas 
Their numerical strength is always nil. However, they are combust in the following circumstances:  Ch within 12° of Sy 
 Ma within 17° of Sy 
 Bu within 13° of Sy 
 Gu within 11° of Sy 
 Sk within 9° of Sy 
 Sa within 15° of Sy 
 Ra within 15° of Sy 
 Ke within 15° of Sy 
Strength of retrograde Grahas 
In SBC a retrograde Graha is assigned special significance because of its special Vedha power & numerical  strength. Here the strength of such a Graha is explained to determine its overall impact on human beings:  Calculate total number of days when a Graha is retrograde i.e. 120 days for Gu (A)  Calculate total number of days from date of start of retrograde motion to day of event i.e. 100 days (B)  Find out midpoint of total days at (A) i.e. 120 / 2 = 60 (C) 
 Find out difference of total days (A) & total days upto event (B) = 120 – 100 = 20 (D)  Presume total numerical strength = 60 (E) 
Rule for determining the strength = 60 (E) / 60 (C) x 20 (D) / 1 
Actual numerical strength = 20 
Strength of exalted Grahas 
In SBC an exalted Graha is assigned special benefic & malefic powers. Here only the formula to determine the  numerical strength is given. Our Sages have suggested different methods to determine the strength. Some of  them are recorded below: 
Rule 1: Longitude of Graha = 9 / 29° / 36' 
Longitude of its debilitation = 6 / 10° / 00' 
Difference = 3 / 19° / 36' 
Divide by 3 = (3 / 19° / 36') / 3 
= 36° / 32' 
Rule 2: Longitude of Graha = 9 / 29° / 36' 
Longitude of its debilitation = 6 / 10° / 00' 
Difference = 3 / 19° / 36' 
Multiply by 7 & divide by 6 = (3 / 19° / 36') x 7 / 6 
= 127° 52'

Vedha of Grahas 
Methodology 
After understanding nature & characteristics of Grahas, the next stage is to determine their Vedha on the five  important components of the individuals. These are as under: 
 Nakshatra at birth occupied by Ch 
 Rasi at birth occupied by Ch 
 Tithi at birth & birth day 
 Consonant - first word of the native's name 
 Vowel - Swara of the native's name 
All these can be determined from the Janma Chakra. In case Janma Chakra is not available, decide on the basis  of most popular latest name of the individual. Now follow the procedure as under. 
Procedure 
 Place all 9 transiting Grahas in their respective Pada of a Nakshatra & Rasi according to their longitude  during transit. 
 Examine their aspect on the five components, which must get Vedha, before their results can be  determined. 
These 9 Grahas have three types of Vedha as under: 
 Sy, Ch, Ra & Ke can aspect all 3 directions. Retrograde Graha can aspect only on the right direction.  Fast Graha can aspect only on the left direction. Graha with normal speed can aspect in front direction  only. 
 Front Vedha of a Graha can only cause Vedha of Nakshatra & Pada in opposite direction.  Right side Vedha by a retrograde Graha can cause Vedha of all five components.  Left side Vedha will also cause Vedha of all five components. 
 Ma, Bu, Gu, Sk, Sa have Vedha in one direction only depending on their speed.  As regards front Vedha by a Graha, some Sages suggested that this Vedha should also cover other 4  components. 
 Right & left Vedha is always angular at 45° and causes Vedha of all components occupying Vargas in  that direction.
29 

Special Vedha aspect 
 Graha in 4th Pada of Bharani causes Vedha of 1st Pada of Krittika and 'A' vowel (by left aspect).  Graha in 4th Pada of Ashlesha causes Vedha of 1st Pada of Magha and 'AA' vowel by left aspect.  Graha in 4th Pada of Visakha causes Vedha of 1st Pada of Anuradha & 'E' vowel (by left aspect). 
 Graha in 4th Pada of Sravana causes Vedha of 1st Pada of Dhanishta & 'EE' vowel (by left aspect).  Graha afflicting Ardra - Ku, Gha, Na, Chha consonants are also afflicted. 
 Graha afflicting Hasta - Pu, Sha, Na, Tha consonants are also afflicted. 
 Graha afflicting Purvashadha - Bu, Dha, Pha & Da consonants are also afflicted.  Graha afflicting Utara Bhadrapada - Du, Tha, Jha, Na consonants are also afflicted.  These consonants are not provided in SBC. Hence their Vedha may be examined in this way. These  (words) consonants belong to different Padas of Nakshatras. 
 Similarly Grahas occupying 4th Pada of Bharani, Aslesha, Visakha & Sravana cause Vedha of 5th, 10th, 15th, 30th Tithi & Saturday which is not possible in normal course. 
 Malefic Grahas: Sy, Sa, Ma, Ra & Ke will cause malefic Vedha only, although they may be in their own  Rasis or even exaltation Rasis. They are 100 % malefic. 
 Benefic Grahas: Ch, Bu, Gu & Sk cause benefic Vedha only. They are 100 % benefic.  Ch is benefic when it is waxing. Bu is benefic when it is alone, especially without any malefic Graha.  Vedha of a Graha is of 2 types. Macro – when a Graha aspect a particular Rasi. Micro - when a Graha aspect a particular Pada of a Nakshatra. This type of Vedha is 100 % effective. 
 Nakshatra to Nakshatra Vedha is less effective than Pada Vedha. 
 Vedha by 2 / 3 Grahas in the same Pada - impact of victorious Graha will prevail. Ma, Bu, Gu, Sk & Sa have only one aspect at a time depending on their speed. 
 Malefic Graha if retrograde becomes highly malefic – 200 %. 
 Benefic Graha if retrograde becomes highly benefic – 200 %. 
 Malefic Graha when it leaves Vedha Nakshatra & shift to another Nakshatra, it cannot give malefic  results. 
 Vedha of a Tithi in Sukla Paksha is 100 %, whereas Vedha in Krishna Paksha is only 50%.  Each Tithi has its own consonant. So when Tithi has Vedha, the consonant is also having Vedha  automatically. Similarly Rasi of Tithi is also having Vedha. 
 When a Graha is causing Vedha of a particular Rasi, its vowel, consonant & Tithis are also having  Vedha automatically. 
 Retrograde Graha on 1st Pada of Krittika, 1th Pada of Magha, 1st Pada of Anuradha, 1st Pada of  Dhanishta causes Vedha of 4 Vowels – A, AA, E & EE & Tithis – 5th, 10th, 15th, 30th & Saturday.

 In the above chart each benefic Graha has 5 Vedha points. 
 Each malefic Graha has 4 Vedha points. 
 To determine the benefic or malefic influence, take the difference of both, benefic & malefic group of  Grahas. The total difference will indicate the actual impact of Vedha.
30 


Navamsa Vedha 
 Every Nakshatra has 4 Padas. So all the 28 Nakshatras, including Abhijit, have 112 Navamsas in SBC.  Grahas cause Vedha of these Navamsa, by their opposite (front) direction, i.e. a Graha in 1st Pada of  Krittika will cause Vedha of 4th Pada of Sravana, including Pada's vowels & consonants & Nakshatra.  This is known as Navamsa Vedha. It gives strong results when the Navamsa Rasi has also Vedha. 
Special Vedha of Sy 
In SBC, Sy has been assigned special powers to cause directional Vedha in addition to Vedha of five  components. It means, when Sy occupies a direction, East, West, North or South, the whole direction is afflicted  for three months, from the date of entry in that direction till it leaves the last Rasi. In this way all 12 Rasis of the  4 directions are afflicted. This type of Vedha is to be calculated from Krittika in the East. If you examine the SBC  Chakra, you will find Vedha details as under when Sy occupies any Nakshatra or Rasi in that direction: 
East direction 
 Vedha of Nakshatras from Krittika to Ashlesha. 
 Vedha of Rasis from 4th Pada of Mesha to Karka. 
 Vedha of vowels – A, OO, O, LRI. 
 Vedha of consonants, assigned to each Pada of a Nakshatra. 
 Vedha of Tithi. 
South direction 
 Vedha of Nakshatras from 1st Pada of Magha to 4th Pada of Visakha. 
 Vedha of Rasi from Simha to Tula. 
 Vedha of vowels – AA, OO, OU, LREE. 
 Vedha of consonants assigned to each Pada of Nakshatra. 
 Vedha of Tithi. 
West direction 
 Vedha of Nakshatras from 1st Pada of Anuradha to 4th Pada of Sravana. 
 Vedha of Rasis from Vriscika to Makara. 
 Vedha of vowels – E, RE, AE, AM. 
 Vedha of consonants assigned to each Pada of Nakshatra. 
 Vedha of Tithi. 
North direction: 
 Vedha of Nakshatras from 1st Pada of Dhanishta to 4th Pada of Bharani. 
 Vedha of Rasis from Makara to Mesha. 
 Vedha of vowels – EE, REE, AEI, AHA. 
 Vedha of consonants assigned to each Pada of a Nakshatra. 
 Vedha of Tithi. 
 Similarly when Sy occupies a particular Nakshatra, three Nakshatras before & after are afflicted by Sy including the Nakshatra occupied by it. 
 Similarly when a malefic Graha afflicts any Pada of a Nakshatra (by conjunction or aspect), the  consonants and vowels are also afflicted. This causes danger to life & position especially when all 5  components are afflicted. 
 Similarly when one of the following vowel is having Vedha, its counterpart is also having Vedha:
Vowels having Vedha 
Vowel having automatic Vedha
A 
AA
E 
EE
U (small) 
OO (big)
RE

Front Vedha 
As already indicated, some Sages have recommended front Vedha of Nakshatra only. But some eminent Sages  have suggested front Vedha of all five Panchkas. I suggest front Vedha of all the five components should be  considered but its benefic impact is only 50%. 
Special note on Vedha 
Vedha means a special relationship between Graha in motion & other celestial bodies, which are fixed in the  SBC of the native. Aspects by Grahas play important role in influencing human life, nations, commerce, trade,  industries, agricultural products, market fluctuations. The benefic or malefic impact depends on strength of  Graha, it's benefic or malefic nature, it's motion (speed), its conjunction with other Grahas - when 2 Grahas 
occupy same longitude in a Nakshatra or its Pada, or aspect by 2 Grahas occupying 2 different Rasis but  occupying same degree in their Rasis or opposition aspect by 2 Grahas opposite each other at a distance of 180°, i.e. Sy 10° in Mesha and Sa 10° in Tula. This aspect is most dangerous. 
Vedha by benefic Grahas in lucky years. 
According to Astrology, 9th Bhava Lord & its occupants are lucky Grahas.

Normal Vedha of Grahas 
Sy 
It has uniform speed. So it has Vedha power of aspecting all the directions – right, left & front. Ch 
As above. 
Ra & Ke 
These two Grahas have uniform speed and being retrograde throughout the year. Hence these two Grahas also  have Vedha power of aspecting all three directions - right, left & front. 
Ma, Bu, Gu, Sk, Sa 
All these Grahas have no uniform speed. So they will have the Vedha power as under: When retrograde in transit Right direction. 
When in high speed in transit Left direction. 
When in normal speed in transit Front direction. 
I may indicate here that there is some minor difference in Vedha & aspect. Aspect is usually applied in  Astrology. Whereas Vedha is applied in SBC.

Forecasting methodology – future of  individuals 
Introduction 
SBC can be successfully & scientifically applied for prediction of the individual’s future events. For this purpose  carryout the following directions: 
 Prepare a SBC—draw on a metal sheet or wooden plank. 
 Prepare five wooden figures of Janma Nakshatra, Tithi, day, Swar / words and Rasi. In addition, place  9 figures of Janma Grahas according to their longitude. 
 Place all the figures in appropriate Bhavas out of 81 Vargas indicated in SBC. Their position will clearly  indicate the Panchkas position in Janma Chakra. 
 Now place 9 figures of moving Grahas at the time of forecasting in appropriate Padas of Nakshatras.  Mark speed of each Graha - direct, high speed, direct normal speed & retrograde motion.  Decide direction of Vedha - direct, right or left. 
 Decide the benefic / malefic nature of Grahas. 
 Decide the numerical strength of Grahas. 
 Decide whether Graha is rising, combust, exalted or retrograde. 
 Decide & mark Vedha of Panchkas in SBC. 
 Decide the operation and duration of benefic & malefic impact on native according to different Vedha norms.
33 

 Decide Vedha of Nakshatra etc. by benefic Graha & its strength for imparting benefic results.  Similarly decide magnitude of malefic results due to Vedha by a malefic Graha.  Remember that Ch, Bu, Sk & Gu are considered benefic Grahas irrespective of their nature in Janma Chakra. 
 Similarly Ma, Sy, Sa, Ra & Ke are declared malefic Grahas irrespective of their nature in natal Chakra.  Remember front Vedha means Vedha of Nakshatra in opposite direction only. 
 Remember right or left Vedha means Vedha of all the Panchkas of the SBC, including Nakshatra. In addition SBC indicates (in outer space) 12 Rasis & Padas. 
Future of individuals (Prasna norms) 
A SBC can be successfully applied for predicting future of individual. The forecasting may be yearly,  fortnightly or daily. For horary prediction, the methodology is described on the next page. The procedure is as under: 
 Determine the actual longitude of Sy on the first day of Hindu year, first day of Tithi Sukla Paksha &  Krishna Paksha and the longitude of Ch for daily prediction. 
 Place Sy & Ch in the proper Nakshatra in separate SBCs. 
 Place other Grahas in both SBCs as under from the Nakshatra of Sy & Ch irrespective of their actual position (longitude).

Now record Panchkas of individuals in SBC & also record above Grahas in SBC. The forecast will be astonishing but depending on the nature & numerical strength of the Vedha Graha, on those specific dates. The  Vedha results supplement the forecast indicated in SBC. 
In Prasna, find out the actual longitude of Sy & indicate its position in SBC. In addition, indicate the position of  other Grahas as indicated below: 
Graha 
Sy Place Sy in actual Nakshatra occupied by Sy. 
Ch Place Ch in 3rd Nakshatra from Sy‘s Nakshatra. 
Ma -//- 7th -//- 
Bu -//- 13th -//- 
Gu -//- 20th -//- 
Sk -//- 27th -//- 
Ra -//- 19th -//- 
Ke -//- 25th -//- 
In this Chakra also record Panchkas of individuals in SBC and also above Grahas at their appropriate position  in SBC. The Vedha results depend on benefic / malefic strength of Grahas. 
Standard practice for Vedha in SBC 
 Mark five Panchkas in SBC including Janma Lagna. 
 Check up the Vedha affliction of these components by Grahas - benefic as well as malefic - all in transit.  The forecast will be as under:
34 

Vedha by one malefic Graha 
 of one component Failure in efforts, dispute & war. 
 of two components Fear & loss. 
 of three components Destruction & defeat. 
 of four components Illness & death. 
 of five components Death. 
Vedha by 2 / 3 malefic Grahas 
 of Nakshatra Confusion. 
 of Rasi Obstruction. 
 of Tithi Fear, danger. 
 of consonants Financial loss. 
 of vowel (Swar) Illness. 
Vedha by 1 - 5 malefic Grahas 
 Affliction by 1 Graha Confusion & war. 
 do 2 do Loss of relative and danger. 
 do 3 do Troubles & loss. 
 do 4 do Troubles & defeat, sickness or death. 
 do 5 do Death. 
In addition, the Vedha results of each Graha will be as under 
Vedha by Sy 
Tension, dispute with Gov., fever, foreign travel, loss, sufferings, opposition by wife & son, stomach trouble, fear & obstructions. 
Vedha by Ma 
Financial loss, confusion, death in family, loss of property, obstructions, sickness of wife & son, foreign travel,  bleeding & fear. 
Vedha by Sa 
Sickness, danger, loss of relatives, foreign travel, imprisonment, loss of position, serious disease, death, fruitless  travel & obstructions. 
Vedha by Ra 
Obstructions, heart trouble, giddiness, danger, romance with a widow. 
Vedha by Ke 
Loss of wife, danger from Gov., defeat in objectives and pain in body. 
Note 
If Janma Nakshatra is having Gu's Vedha, no harm is possible even if 2 / 3 malefic Grahas have Vedha of five  components. It ensures all types of protection. 
Vedha of a Nakshatra is of three types as under 
 A malefic Graha has just vacated a Nakshatra Malefic event just occurred.  A malefic Graha has just occupied a Nakshatra Malefic event is taking place.  A malefic Graha will soon occupy a Nakshatra Malefic event will occur soon.  Avoid such a day for all important activities. 
 If a benefic Graha has vacated a Nakshatra or has occupied a Nakshatra or will occupy a Nakshatra, benefic results are bound to occur. 
 If Ch has left a Nakshatra, that Nakshatra is not malefic for any auspicious work.  Vedha by Bu Improvement in intelligence.  Vedha by Sk Romance.
35

Additional notes 
 Sy is Atma & is supposed to give benefic results. 
 How Sy will give benefic results, examine Janma Nakshatra & Nadi. 
 Longitude of Sy & Ch is most important and benefic results are assured when benefic Grahas transit or  aspect these points in SBC. 
 Charan (Pada) is most important for determining the micro results, i.e. treat Nakshatra = 1 year & one  Charan = 3 months. 
 Ch transits a Nakshatra for 24 hours. Transit in each Pada indicates 6 hours duration. Whenever any  significator along with Ch transits this Pada or malefic Graha and Markesh enters this Pada indicate  benefic / malefic event during 6 hours. 
 Synchronize native's Janma Chakra, Chalit Chakra & transit Chakra for micro decision. Also examine  Drekkana Chakra for that time.  
 Prepare Shadvargas for different activities. For marriage prepare Navamsa Chakra. Find out Graha ensuring marriage & mark in SBC. 
 Exalted Grahas in natal Chakra & Navamsa Chakra are very powerful & beneficial.  Treat Janma Nakshatra as first year of life & 27th Nakshatra as 27th year. Repeat the cycle again i.e. Janma Nakshatra will indicate 1st year, 28th year, 55th year, 82nd year of life. Find out the benefic years  according to classification of Nakshatras.
40 

 Similarly examine Dasa & Antardasa Lords. If they occupy beneficial Nakshatras, i.e. 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th, the result are bound to be benefic. 
 Synchronizing the above positions of Grahas with SBC, determine the timing of event & also micro  results. 
 Determination of exalted strength & Shadvarga strength is essential to determine benefic & malefic  results & also their potentiality. I.e. Sy Lord of 10th Bhava in natal Chakra, occupies 12th Bhava & Sy is  joined by Ma & aspected by Ra. If Sy is weak, it will give malefic results. 
 Determine significations of each Graha, i.e. Ra indicate death, destruction, demotions and dissolution.  Sa indicates sufferings, losses, unhappiness and failures. 
 Whenever a benefic Graha aspects Punya Saham, it gives benefic & important results in that particular  year, depending on Bhava occupied & owned by such a Graha. 
 Vedha results from Ch's Nakshatra are valid for one year & Vedha results from Sy's Nakshatra are  valid for 9 years. 
 Vedha by a benefic, of Lagna & its Lord is always good. 
 Grahas occupying benefic Nakshatras, i.e. 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th, are always benefic, i.e. Gu in 7th Bhava occupying 4th Pada of Rohini in Vrisabha, Lord of 5th Bhava & occupies Pawan Nadi and aspecting 11th Bhava & 3rd Bhava. Since Gu is exalted in Navamsa, it will ensure heavy legal income from many  sources. 
Special Vedha results of Sy 
Vedha by Sy 
Vedha of Tithi Danger or death possible. 
Vedha of Rasi Setbacks & obstructions. 
Vedha of vowels Sad events, unhappiness & failures. 
Vedha of consonant Financial loss & no success. 
Vedha of Nakshatra Sickness & all round disappointments. 
Vedha of all five Death possible. Avoid marriage, travelling, entering a new house, filing a suit, new  business, new job & election.

Prachand Nadi 
Most dangerous. Two malefic Grahas on this Nadi cause greatest harm. Benefic Grahas (strong) indicate good  luck. 
Pawan Nadi 
Lot of travelling but without any benefic results. 
Dehan Nadi 
Mental tension, setbacks, quarrels, spoils business and career. 
Sobhya Nadi 
Benefic results of Vedha by benefic Grahas. Ensure many type of happy events in the life. Neer Nadi

41 

Jal Nadi 
All expectations are fulfilled. Some benefic & some malefic results are also possible. 
Amrit Nadi 
Ensures permanent benefic results. 
Notes 
 Benefic & malefic Grahas on a particular Nakshatra or Nakshatras of a Nadi will be considered as if  they are moving on all Nakshatras of that Nadi. 
 If Lord of the Nadi (Graha) is moving on a Nakshatra of the Nadi, it will give results according to the  classification of Nadi. 
 If benefic or malefic Graha alone move over Nadi, either with Ch or without Ch, result will not be  satisfactory. If only two benefic Grahas occupy a Nadi, it is most beneficial. 
 If benefic Graha along with Ch (Full) joins on Neer, Jal or Amrit, it ensures benefic results.  If benefic Graha along with benefic Ch joins Amrit Nadi, it ensures many happy and permanent  results. 
 If benefic Grahas (two or three) along with one or two malefic Grahas join on Prachand, Pawan or  Dehan Nadi, they give 25 % benefic results only. 
 If more malefic Grahas & less benefic Grahas occupy Neer, Jal & Amrit Nadi, they give unsatisfactory  results. 
 If Sk & Ch occupy Neer, Jal & Amrit Nadi, they give most benefic results. 
 If Sk & Ch occupy Prachand, Pawan & Dehan Nadi, they indicate only hope but no achievement.  If Sy, Ch & Sk occupy any Nadi, they indicate realization of objectives. 
 If Ch, Gu & Sk or Ch, Bu, Gu & Sk occupy a Nadi, they indicate benefic results of permanent nature.  If Sy, Ch & Sa occupy any Nadi they indicate most malefic period. 
 Any strong, retrograde or exalted Graha on Jal Nadi indicates success in efforts.  If Grahas are strong, malefic having malefic relations indicate only malefic results.  If fast moving Graha is ahead of slow moving Graha, on a Nakshatra, but both benefic, ensure success  & happy results. 
 If two or more Grahas occupy any Nadi, they give results according to Nadi's name.  If any Graha occupies or moves on its own Nadi, it gives results according to the name of the Nadi.  If Ma occupies or moves on any other Nadi, in addition to its own Nadi, it gives results of that Nadi  only. 
 If Ch along with two benefic Grahas movesin any Nadi Nakshatra, it ensures most benefic results. 
Vedha results of Upagrahas 
Upagrahas given in the following chart are counted from Nakshatra occupied by Sy and indicate Nakshatra occupied by them on a particular day. These Nakshatras indicate malefic day for all purpose & failures if some  activity is carried out on that day.

Notes 
 The above position of Nakshatra does not include Abhijit Nakshatra.
42 

 If these Nakshatras are afflicted along with Janma Nakshatra by malefic conjunction or aspect, the  malefic results will be more serious. 
 If two malefic Grahas are jointly afflicting above sensitive Nakshatras – from Sy, along with Janma Nakshatra, even death may take place. 
 Day's Nakshatras, occupied by malefic Grahas, are Nakshatras 5, 8, 14, 18, 21, 22, 23 and 24 are 100 %  malefic days and should be avoided for all purposes. Otherwise malefic events may take place.  If Janma Nakshatra itself is occupied by Upagraha, this indicates a serious warning. It may cause bad  health, accident, dispute. If a malefic Graha & Upagraha falls on Janma Nakshatra, this is a serious indication & may cause death. 
Vedha of Nakshatras, from Janma Nakshatra by Grahas and their Vedha results 
Janma Nakshatra Janma Danger to native & death – if Vedha by 2 strong malefic Grahas. 2nd Nakshatra Sampath Wealth & prosperity - benefic aspect necessary. 3rd Nakshatra Vipath Accident if aspected by 2 strong malefic Grahas. 4th Nakshatra Kshemya Happiness & prosperity if aspected by benefic Grahas. 5th Nakshatra Pratwara Loss of business & obstacles depending on malefic aspect. 6th Nakshatra Sadhaka Success in efforts, depending on sincere efforts. 7th Nakshatra Naidhana Sudden death & loss if Vedha by 2 strong malefic Grahas. 8th Nakshatra Maitra Financial gain & success through friend. 
9th Nakshatra Parammaitra Financial gain & success through very intimate friend. 10th Nakshatra Karma Disputes, sufferings and unhappiness.

Notes 
 Any benefic Graha having Vedha of benefic Nakshatras, i.e. 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th from Janma Nakshatra, benefic results are assured with full satisfaction. 
 Any malefic Graha having Vedha of malefic Nakshatras, i.e. 3rd, 5th, 7th, the malefic results will increase.  Any benefic / malefic Graha having Vedha of Janma Nakshatra, results will be according to Graha's  nature. 
 Janma Nakshatra may be treated as Lagna, if Vedha is caused by benefic Graha, it causes wealth,  respect, position, good health etc. If Vedha is by malefic Graha, it may even cause death.  Nakshatra are always fixed & cannot give benefic / malefic results unless Grahas transit these  Nakshatras. Grahas move in Zodiac. Their influence & impact in SBC is most important.  Nakshatra Vedha in SBC is considered most important for all types of predictions.  Vedha of Janma Nakshatra in the same Pada by a strong malefic or two malefics may even cause death.  Janma Nakshatra is the first Nakshatra of Janma, 10th Nakshatra (Karma Nakshatra) is also Janma Nakshatra, but malefic impact on this Nakshatra is much less. Similarly 19th Nakshatra (Adhana
43 

Nakshatra) is also Janma Nakshatra, malefic impact on this Nakshatra will not cause death, but only  separation from family & foreign travel. 
 Vedha of Janma Nakshatra may be direct or indirect. However if Latta Nakshatras & Upagrahas Nakshatras are also synchronized, the impact of malefic Vedha will be severe. 
Forecasting methodology - how to  determine benefic Muhurta 
Introduction 
Astrology has prescribed large number of benefic Muhurtas - common for all purposes. In addition Astrology  has prescribed special Muhurtas for each auspicious activity i.e. entering into a new house, marriage, buying  vehicle or gold, post natal ceremonies, education, opening a new shop or starting a new business, travel etc. In SBC when some benefic Grahas in motion transit Janma Nakshatra and other consonants of native, create  most auspicious Muhurtas for all types of activities. This Muhurta should however be synchronized with  auspicious Muhurta according to natal Chakra of native. 
Methodology 
Mark following auspicious Nakshatras in SBC of native: 
Type of Nakshatras in general 
Janma Nakshatras 1, 10, 19 Neutral 
Sampath Nakshatras 2, 11, 20 Benefic 
Vipath Nakshatras 3, 12, 21 Malefic 
Kshemya Nakshatras 4, 13, 22 Benefic 
Pratwara Nakshatras 5, 14, 23 Malefic 
Sadhaka Nakshatras 6, 15, 24 Benefic 
Naidhana Nakshatras 7, 16, 25 Malefic 
Maitra Nakshatras 8, 17, 26 Benefic 
Param Maitra Nakshatras 9, 18, 27 Benefic 
Notes 
 Above system does not include Abhijit. 
 Janma Nakshatra can be determined from Nakshatra occupied by Ch. 
 If Janma Chakra is not available, determine Nakshatra according to the latest popular name of native.  Ensure benefic aspect on Janma Nakshatra, Janma Tithi, Ch Rasi, Navamsa Rasi, on a particular day. If  there is no malefic aspect, it indicates 100 % success. 
 If malefic Vedha is prominent, it indicates failures. 
 If all four benefic Grahas are having Vedha, 100 % success is assured. 
 If only Gu is causing benefic Vedha, it indicates improvement, success, gain & victory.  If only Sk is causing benefic Vedha, it indicates happiness and romance. 
 If only Bu is causing benefic Vedha, it indicates success in examination. 
 If all malefic Grahas are having Vedha - l00 % failure in efforts, death & financial loss is possible.  If Sy is causing Vedha, it indicates disappointment and tension. 
 If Ma is causing Vedha, it indicates dispute, accident or death. 
 If Sa is causing Vedha, it indicates serious sickness & loss. 
 If Ra is causing Vedha, it indicates accident & injury. 
 If Ke is causing Vedha, it indicates food poisoning. 
 If Janma Nakshatra is having malefic Vedha, it indicates loss. 
 If Janma Rasi is having malefic Vedha, it indicates demotion and setbacks in profession.  If Navamsa is having malefic Vedha, it indicates failures, disappointment & death.  Benefic & malefic Nakshatras should be clearly marked in SBC.
44 

 When 2 / 3 malefic Grahas conjunct or aspect 1st, 10th or 19th Nakshatra, reject such a time for all  important activities. 
 Nakshatras at number 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, 16, 21, 23, 25 are most malefic & avoid all important activities on  days, which are occupied by these Nakshatras. 
 If malefic Grahas are having Vedha of Panchkas, results will be as under: 
o Marriage Marital discord & divorce. 
o Travel Never return back. 
o Medical treatment No recovery. 
o Financial transactions No recovery & loss. 
 If Sy is involved in malefic Vedha Disappointments. 
 If Ma is involved in malefic Vedha Death. 
 If Sa is involved in malefic Vedha Financial loss. 
 If Ra is involved in malefic Vedha Accident. 
 If Ke is involved in malefic Vedha Poisoning. 
 If malefic Ch is involved in malefic Vedha Malefic results. 
 If malefic Graha / Grahas is / are strong, such a day must be avoided for all auspicious activities.  Whenever Sy transit any direction in SBC - East, South, West or North - Rasi, Nakshatra, Navamsa etc.  become combust & most inauspicious. 
 Whenever any malefic Graha is causing Vedha of a particular Pada of a particular Nakshatra, whole  Nakshatra become malefic & should be avoided. 
 Avoid conjunction of malefic Graha on Janma Nakshatra. 
 Avoid aspect of malefic Graha on Janma Nakshatra. 
 Avoid Janma Nakshatra if occupied by Latta Nakshatra. 
 Avoid Janma Nakshatra if happens to be a Nakshatra occupied by Upagraha. 
 Avoid aspect of malefic Grahas on other Janma components. 
 Avoid day on which Janma Nakshatra is occupied by Sy, Ma or Sa. 
 Avoid day on which Nakshatras 10, 19, 12, 23, 16, 25 are occupied by Sy, Ma, Sa or malefic Ch.  Avoid the day which is owned by Janma Nakshatra and is occupied by all malefic Grahas. 
Another method for determining benefic / malefic Muhurta 
Decide malefic sensitive Nakshatras from Sy which are owned by Upagrahas. These Nakshatras falling on a  particular day are considered malefic as under. These should be avoided for all auspicious activities specially  marriage:

Notes 
Exclude Abhijit for counting position of Upagrahas. In addition, if Janma Nakshatra is also afflicted by malefic  conjunction or aspect, malefic results will be more serious, even death. So avoid days on which the above  Upagrahas Nakshatras are located & there is malefic Vedha also on Nakshatra and also Janma Nakshatra. Viz  Janma Nakshatra is occupied by an Upagraha & also having Vedha by malefics.

I.e. if Sy is on Krittika, than it will effect Chitra, being 12th Nakshatra from its own position. Such a Nakshatra should be avoided for all purpose. In such a case when such a Vedha Nakshatra (Chitra) has malefic  conjunction or Vedha by malefic Graha, it becomes very malefic. 
When any Graha is retrograde, find out the position by reversing the above combinations. Any malefic Graha in transit conjuncting or having Vedha of Latta Nakshatra, defeat, death, travel, widowhood  is possible. 
For counting the position of Latta Nakshatra, do not include Abhijit. Consider only 27 Nakshatras. Forecasting methodology - Prasna 
Introduction 
There are several methods in Astrology to determine benefic / malefic future of an individual or of a county or  a specific problem. Whenever horoscope is not available, such questions can be answered through Prasna.  Prasna is frequently applied in Astrology. Similarly Prasna is applied in SBC, and correct answers can be given  through SBC. SBC norms are as under: 
Methodology 
 Erect SBC for the moment when somebody asks a question. 
 Determine first letter of the question put up by any individual. 
 This letter may be treated as consonant, just like name of the individual. 
 Then find out Pada, Nakshatra, owned by this consonant. 
 From consonant & Pada of Nakshatra, you can decide Rasi & also vowel. 
 Examine if this consonant, Pada of Nakshatra & Rasis are afflicted by any malefic Graha, transiting a  Nakshatra or Rasi from where it is casting a malefic Vedha on consonant etc. lf so, malefic results are  bound to happen. 
 If there are both benefic & malefic aspects, then mixed results are possible.
46 

 If Rasi involved is 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th Rasi (movable), then lost item will not be recovered, a sick person  may die, newborn child may not live long & success in any effort may not be possible.  If Rasi involved is 2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th Rasi (fixed), then benefic results are indicated. Lost items may be  recovered after some time, sick man will recover & success in any effort will be possible.  If Rasi involved is 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th Rasi (dual), then success is indicated any moment.  If one Panchka or a Nakshatra is afflicted by two malefic Grahas from two sides, death of a sick person  is possible. 
 If Rasi has benefic Vedha, benefic results are possible, but depending on strength of Graha.  If consonant is afflicted, it indicates loss of position. 
 If consonant is afflicted by two sides, death is possible. 
 If consonant is afflicted by two or more malefic Vedha then loss of position, death & loss of property is  possible. 
In addition see Chapter 18 - Dhuajadi Chakra for synchronizing the results. 
Forecasting methodology - how to  determine prices of commodities 
Introduction 
For commercial community the prices of a commodity, at a particular time & in a particular city play a very  important role to determine their business success. Our ancient Sages have laid down very useful norms to  determine price fluctuation through SBC. Before norms are explained, we should know important Panchkas for  determining price level. 
Definitions 
 Country: Regions, states & cities. I.e. Bharat, Delhi state, New Delhi. 
 Commodity: Dhatu, root (Moola), living things (Jiva). I.e. Gold, trees, animals / persons.  Time: Year, month, day. 
Significators 
 Dhatu Sa, Ma & Ra. 
 Root (Moola) Sy, Sk & Ke. 
 Jiva (all type of living things) Ch, Bu, Gu. 
 Country Stronger among Sa, Gu & Ra. 
 Region or state Stronger among Sy, Sk & Ke. 
 Town or city Stronger among Ch, Ma & Bu. 
 Year Sa, Gu, Ra & Ke. 
 Month Sy, Ma, Bu or Sk. 
 Day Always Ch - useful for predicting daily fluctuations. 
Male Grahas Sy, Gu, Ma, Ra & Ke. 
Female Grahas Ch & Sk. 
Eunuchs Sa & Bu. 
Colors White Sk & Ch. 
Red Sy & Ma. 
Yellow Gu. 
Black Sa, Ra & Ke. 
Green Bu. 
 Commencing of year Gu's Sankranti - when Gu enters a new Rasi or Chaitra Sukla Pratipada.  Commencing of month Pratipada of Sukla Paksha. 
 Commencing of day When Sy rises.
47 

Notes 
 Whenever year, month and date in a country are different, that date should be considered.  Dhatu (metals) Gold, silver, iron, steel, copper, brass etc. 
 Moola (root) Vegetables, fruits, herbs etc. 
 Jiva (living things) Man, animals, birds, insects. 
 Country Note first word of popular name and determine consonant, vowel and also  determine Nakshatra, Rasi & Tithi of country. 
 Commodity Similarly from first word of commodity, decide Panchkas.  Time Similarly decide the Panchkas from the 1st Tithi and from Tithi find out the  Nakshatra & Rasi. 
 Sometimes consonant & vowel are same. In such cases, treat first word of most popular latest name as  consonant & also vowel, i.e. Amar. 
 Prepare Panchka Chakra of country, commodity & time and also Padas of their Nakshatras.  Decide strength of transiting Grahas & their position. 
 Decide Rasi Lord of the country, commodity & time. 
 Decide Graha causing affliction either by aspect or conjunction. 
 Total impact of benefic or malefic Vedha depends on strength of Grahas causing Vedha.  Strength of Graha causing Vedha: 
o Rasi Own Friends Neutral Enemy o Benefic Grahas 100 % 75 % 50 % 25 % 
o Malefic Grahas 25 % 50 % 75 % 100 % 
 Grahas are stronger when in the middle of Rasi. 
 Graha if exalted, benefic / malefic strength will be three times. 
 Graha if debilitated, benefic / malefic strength will only be 50 %. 
 If Lord of country or commodity or time is also a Vedha Graha, impact will be 100 %, if friendly 75 %, if  neutral 50 % and if enemy, impact of price variations will be 25 %. 
 Synchronize relations between Lords of country, state, city, year, month, day, and commodity with  actual Lords based on name of country, state, city etc. whether they are friends, enemy or neutral. 
Methodology 
 Now decide a particular commodity & its popular name in that city or state. 
 Find out Nakshatra of the commodity & mark in SBC. 
 Mark benefic / malefic relation of Grahas with Nakshatra of commodity. 
 Note conjunction & Vedha of Grahas, which should always be actual - maximum within 1 degree.  Record carefully conjunction aspect & Vedha of relevant Graha on concerned Nakshatra of commodity.  Note prevailing price of that commodity on first day of year, month & Monday.  Also prepare a horoscope of each date / day & study according to astrological principles.  If malefic relation is there, price increase is possible. 
Percentage of price variations can be decided as under 
 Note ruling prices on a particular day. 
 Divide ruling price by 20. 
 Each unit will indicate price variation. 
 Compare this price with prices prevailing on first day of year, month & Monday.  Similarly record relations of Grahas, Nakshatra on any future date & determine increase / decrease by  synchronizing prices one year back, one month back or Monday with current prices and accordingly  determine future trend. 
 Find out from 9 Grahas, total benefic / malefic influence on prices, deduct them & determine actual  influence. 
 Since Grahas have three types of speed, price variation is also of three types - very high, high and  average.
48 

 Now you can determine trend, either very high, high or average increase from benefic or malefic influence. 
 Similarly prepare grading of previous closing. 
 If there is benefic Vedha by benefic Grahas - Mandi (depression) is possible. 
Another Method 
 Decide starting time & closing time of prices. It may be a year or a month or a day. It means two  periods - previous closing and future prices. 
 Decide actual longitude of Grahas. 
 Decide Vedha of Grahas according to their speed. Record speed & direction of Grahas.  Decide actual Vedha of Nakshatra, Pada of Nakshatra, Navamsa Vedha and other Panchkas of country,  time & commodity. 
 Decide strength of Grahas - in own, in friend's, in enemy's, in neutral Bhava, also note if Graha is rising,  combust, retrograde or exalted. 
Carefully record 
 Panchkas of city, time & commodity. 
 Pada Vedha by 9 Grahas. 
 Pada aspect by 9 Grahas. 
 Strength of benefic / malefic Vedha of Pada by 9 Grahas. 
 Find out difference at both times. 
 Difference will indicate rise & fall of prices. 
 In case any country, state or city has many names, latest name assigned to that country, state or city  should be considered. 
Another method 
 Note prevailing price of a commodity on 2nd Tithi, after Amavasya. 
 Note relation of Nakshatra of commodity & Grahas of commodity on 2nd Tithi (after Amavasya).  Examine relation of Ch on Panchkas of commodity. 
 Price will come down when Ch is bright & has benefic relation with Panchkas.  Decide commodities from Nakshatra on which Ch is transiting on a particular day.  Price may also fall when Ch is malefic on 2nd Tithi after Amavasya. Commodity can be decided from  Ch Nakshatra on that date.

Ma When with another fast moving Graha, market picks up. If Sa, Neptune, Pluto are with Ma, it  causes Teji. 
Bu Lot of fluctuation if Bu remains in a Rasi for more than 25 days. It causes sudden fluctuations in  all important commodities for short period. 
Bu It causes Mandi, if ahead of Sy. 
Bu It causes lot of fluctuations if joined by Sy. 
Bu Exalted with Sy, causes Teji. 
Bu Debilitated with Sy, causes Mandi. 
Bu Retrograde, same trend for 7 days. 
Gu Causes Mandi, when Nakshatra or Rasi is moveable. 
Gu Causes Teji if joined by a malefic Graha. 
Gu Causes sudden Teji if joined by Uranus. 
Sk Causes both Mandi & Teji.

Sk + Pluto Causes Teji. 
Sa Causes Teji. 
Sa + Ra or Neptune Teji due to shortage. 
Hershel (Uranus) Mandi. 
Hershel + benefic Graha Mandi. 
Hershel + malefic Graha Teji. 
Neptune Teji. 
Neptune + malefic Graha Teji.

Timing of events 
 First Vedha of Nakshatra, Rasi, Tithi, consonant, vowel by a Graha should take place in any one Bhava.  Thereafter when Ch also causes Vedha of same Panchkas, benefic or malefic event takes place.  In case malefic Vedha of Nakshatra etc., price of the commodity, signified by concerned Nakshatra may  rise. 
 In case of benefic Vedha, price may fall.

As already explained in Chapter 3, the SBC contains following Panchkas. All these Panchkas are properly  placed in SBC in their appropriate Vargas.

2. Latta Chakra 
Some malefic sensitive points are determined with help Latta Chakra. Latta means casting a malefic influence  on a particular Nakshatra, at a particular distance by a particular Graha. First prepare Latta Chakra and  understand its applications.

Notes 
 Latta means a kick by a Graha, a Nakshatra which is declared as most malefic sensitive point.  Counting should be done from the Nakshatra occupied by each Graha either forward or backward as  indicated in the above chart. 
 Ra being always retrograde, backward of Ra means forward of Ra's face. 
 Front indicates clockwise direction, behind means anticlockwise direction. 
 Latta Nakshatra indicates only the malefic Nakshatra of the day whether the Latta is by a benefic Graha or a malefic Graha. 
 In Prasna find out the Nakshatra of the day & then find out the Nakshatra occupied by other Grahas. If  day's Nakshatra is influenced by any Latta Nakshatra, the results will be according to that Graha’s  Latta. 
 In Muhurta, suppose you are planning to enter in a new house on a day which is occupied by Revati.  This Nakshatra is not Latta Nakshatra from, Sy, Ma, Gu, Sa, as they do not occupy 12th, 3rd, 6th, 8th Nakshatra in forward position. Similarly Ch, Bu, Sk, Ra / Ke do not occupy 22nd, 7th, 5th, 9th Nakshatra in backward position. This means the day is benefic and Latta does not exist on that day.  In war, Latta indicates defeat or death. 
 In travelling, the native never returns. 
 In marriage, the widowhood is possible. 
 In Sy's Latta with Ma indicates loss of position, loss of property, loss of wealth & serious disease.  In Ch‘s Latta with Ma, serious danger. 
 In Sy's & Ma Latta on Janma Nakshatra, loss of wealth, sickness, wound, serious danger.  In Sy’s, Ch's & Ma Latta on Janma Nakshatra, serious danger. 
 In Sy’s, Sa's Latta on Janma Nakshatra, sickness danger, difficulties. 
 In Sy, Sa & Ch's Latta on Janma Nakshatra, very serious sickness is indicated. 
 In Sa’s, Ra's or Ke's Latta on Janma Nakshatra very serious sickness is indicated.  In Gu’s Latta on Janma Nakshatra, sickness. 
 In Sk's Latta on Janma Nakshatra, loss of wife. 
 In Sy's Latta on Janma Nakshatra, foreign travel, skin disease. 
 In Sy's Latta on Janma Nakshatra with Ma, loss of wealth etc. 
 In Sy's Latta on Janma Nakshatra with Bu, separation from family. 
 In Sy's Latta on Janma Nakshatra with Gu, danger from Gov.. 
 In Sy's Latta on Janma Nakshatra with Sk, separation from wife. 
 In Sy's Latta on Janma Nakshatra with Sa, loss of gold, animals & crops. 
 In Sy's Latta on Janma Nakshatra with Ra, danger, destruction & death. 
 In Latta of malefic Graha on Janma Nakshatra, also occupied by a malefic Graha & an Upagraha =  Sickness. 
 In above circumstances if Graha is in retrograde movement = death.
59 
Example of Nakshatra Vedha 
 I.e. Sy occupies Krittika Nakshatra, the 12th Nakshatra from Krittika is Chitra Nakshatra, which is  having Latta of Sy. 
 When the day’s Nakshatra is having Latta of any Graha, it should be avoided for any auspicious work,  specially marriage, war, litigation, entering a new house, new application, investment & foreign travel. 
6. Kurm Chakra 
Introduction 
It is most useful Chakra and helps in determining directions and places of malefic and benefic events, especially in India. This chakra is a supporting Chakra for making correct predictions according to SBC. The literary  meaning of kurm is tortoise. Main purpose of this Chakra is to determine different directions belonging to  different Nakshatras. 

The Kurm Chakra is divided into nine zones and each zone is signified by three Nakshatras. I.e. central zone is  signified by Krittika, Rohini, Mrigasira. As far as India's central zone is concerned, it denotes UP (South /  West), Madhya Pradesh (Pt.), Rajasthan (Desert Area), Haryana & Gadwal. Complete details of India's zones  are given in Chapter 17. Whenever Nakshatras of that zone are afflicted by strong malefic Graha, that zone &  dwellers of that zone suffers. Affliction means transit of strong malefic Graha on that Nakshatra signifying a  particular zone, region, state or city. If more than one malefic Graha is involved, large scale destruction of that  zone is possible. Sometimes the whole direction is afflicted by malefic Grahas – Sa, Ra, Ma, Ke & Sy.

7. Dhrubank Chakra 
In addition to SBC, our Sages have recommended use of Dhrubank Chakra for determining prices of  commodities and shares at any future date. This Chakra will also enable to synchronize price of any commodity  as per SBC. Our Sages have assigned a numerical number for following Panchkas of Dhrubank Chakra:  Dhrubank of commodities or shares. 
 Dhrubank of city. 
 Dhrubank of Nakshatra. 
 Dhrubank of Tithi. 
 Dhrubank of day.

4. Astrological norms for success in secondary market 
Secondary market involves sales and purchase of shares in stock exchange through a broker. It is natural that  you will like to sell shares when market is bullish [?] and you will like to purchase shares when market is  bearish [?]. Hence I will record here all possible Yogas causing bullish (Teji) and also causing bearish (Mandi) in  share market. 
Norms for bullish market (Teji) 
 Bu is behind Sa, Gu, Ma or Sk in same Nakshatra. Teji will continue till Bu is behind these Grahas. As  soon as Bu crosses longitude of Graha, ahead of it, Teji factor will gradually slow down. If Ch is ahead  of Bu Teji factor will not work. 
 Bu is behind Pluto, Neptune or Uranus, Ra or Ke preferably in same Nakshatra and is aspected by Sa and Ma by 7th aspect. Sa and Ma should not be retrograde, combust or debilitated. 
 Bu is opposite Pluto, Neptune or Uranus. Maximum Teji will be possible when Bu is 180° from any of  these Grahas. 
 Bu is combust by Sy. Teji factor will continue till Bu is combust. 
 Bu is retrograde and is ahead of Sy in same Rasi. Teji factor will continue till Bu is retrograde.  Bu & Sa, both are retrograde in same Rasi. 
 Bu in Mina & Gu in Mithuna or Kanya. 
 Bu in Dhanur & Gu in Mithuna or Kanya. 
 Bu in Kumbha & is behind Ma in same Nakshatra. 
 Gu is going to be retrograde or direct. Teji will take place on that date. 
 Gu and Sa, both retrograde or in Mesha, Simha, Tula, Vriscika or Makara Rasi. No other Graha must  influence this combination. 
 Gu is retrograde in 5th Bhava having malefic aspect or conjunction. 
 Gu and Sk are opposite each other in same longitude. 
 Gu is combust by Sy. Teji will continue till Gu is combust. 
 Gu in Mithuna or Kanya Rasi and Ra in Dhanur or Mina Rasi respectively. 
 Gu is behind Pluto, Neptune, Uranus, Ra, Ke or Sa in same Nakshatra. Teji will continue till Gu is  behind any of these Grahas. 
 Gu is retrograde in Mina Rasi along with Sa - rise in iron shares. 
 Gu is retrograde in Mesha, Simha, Vriscika or Makara Rasi along with direct Sa.  Gu and Ma in Karka, Dhanur, Mina, Mesha, Vriscika, Makara Rasi. Ma should be behind Gu.  Sk is behind Ma in Makara Rasi. 
 Sk is behind any slow moving Graha in Dhanur Rasi. 
 Sk and Sy in Mina Rasi but in different Nakshatra provided Sk is behind Sy. 
 Sk in Karka Rasi in 5th or 11th Bhava. 
 Sk in Dhanur Rasi in 5th or 11th Bhava. 
 Sa is retrograde in Tula Rasi. 
 Sa is retrograde in 5th Bhava having a malefic aspect or conjunction. 
 Sa and Ma opposite each other in same longitude or are having an exchange. 
 Sa and Ma transit in Mesha, Karka or Simha Rasi, but both Grahas are combust.  Sa, Ma and Sy in Makara Rasi and Ra in Mesha Rasi. 
 Sa is transiting Kumbha Rasi with Sy or Ma or Ra, provided Sa is ahead of Sy / Ma / Ra.  Sa is retrograde in Mesha or Simha Rasi with Ma. 
 Sa in Mina Rasi & Ma behind it in same Rasi. 
 Sa in Mesha, Simha, Vriscika or Makara Rasi along with retrograde Gu or any of Graha out of Ma, Sy, Sk or Ra.
68 

 Any fast moving Graha is behind slow moving Graha in same Nakshatra. Rising continue till fast  moving Graha crosses slow moving Graha. 
 Ma enters Pushya, Anuradha, U. Bhadrapada owned by Sa and also occupied by Sa. Ma should be  behind Sa. 
 9th Lord conjuncts with 10th Lord in Lagna, 5th or 11th Bhava. 
 Lagna Lord and 11th Lord aspect each other. 
 Any of 9 Grahas are behind Pluto, Neptune or Uranus. 
 Any two Grahas exchange their Rasis and also aspect each other and one of them occupies a malefic  Rasi. 
 Any two friendly Grahas aspect each other by 5th or 9th aspect and are in same degree but in different  Bhavas. 
 When maximum number of Grahas transit Mesha, Vrisabha, Simha, Vriscika, Dhanur and Makara Rasi. Notes 
 All above combinations should be related to 5th Bhava, 5th Lord, 11th Bhava & 11th Lord wherever possible. 
 Success is assured when Lagna Lord occupies 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th Bhava, Sa, Ma & Sy occupy 3rd, 6th, 11th Bhava and Gu, Bu and Sk occupy 5th or 9th Bhava. 
 Rising start when fast moving Graha is one degree behind slow moving Graha. These Grahas should be  Lords of Lagna and 11th Bhava. 
 Two Grahas have 5th or 9th aspect within orbit as under: 
o Sy 15°, Ch 12°, Ma 8°, Bu 7°, Gu 9°, Sk 7° and Sa 9°. 
 Maximum high market will be at the moment when fast moving Graha coincides with slow moving  Graha in same Nakshatra. Thereafter prices will decline. 
 At time of sale of shares, Ch should occupy any of following Nakshatra and is transiting Lagna, 5th Bhava or 11th Bhava of Chakra: 

o Purva Phalguni o Purva Bhadrapada o Purva Shada 
o Visakha 
o Krittika o Ashlesha o Bharani 

 At time of sale keep Ch in 3rd, 6th, 10th or 11th Bhava alone and aspected by a strong Graha.  At time of sale of shares, keep 11th Bhava strong. 
 At time of sale of shares, Lagna and 10th Bhava should be occupied or aspected by strong Grahas.  At time of sale of shares, 5th Bhava and 5th Lord should be aspected by strong benefic Grahas. 
Norms causing bearish trend (Mandi) 
 When a slow moving Graha is behind a fast moving Graha in same Nakshatra of a Rasi.  When a slow moving Graha occupies own Rasi or exaltation Rasi and fast moving Graha occupies any  other Rasi. 
 Gu is behind Sy, Ch, Ma, Bu or Sk in same Nakshatra or Gu is ahead of Sa, Ra, Ke, Pluto, Neptune or  Uranus. 
 Ra and Ke are behind Sk (R), Gu having fewer degrees than Ra and Ke. 
 Sa (R) is ahead of Ra or Ke. 
 Any of 9 Grahas are ahead of Pluto, Neptune or Uranus. 
 When two friendly and benefic Grahas have 5th or 9th aspect and both Grahas are in same degree, i.e. Sy in Mesha 10° and Ch in Simha 10°. 
 Bearish trend starts as soon as Ch enters Simha Rasi and continues till it achieves longitude of Sy 10°. In  this case fast moving Graha should always be ahead of slow moving Graha. 
 When two friendly Grahas have 3rd or 11th aspect and both Grahas are in same degree. Rest as above.  Gu retrograde or Sa retrograde in 5th Bhava or Neptune (R) in second Bhava.
